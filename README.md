# ðŸ¦€ Type-State Pattern in Rust

This repository demonstrates the use of the **type-state pattern** in Rust
â€” a design pattern where an objectâ€™s state is encoded in its type. This
allows the compiler to enforce valid state transitions at compile time,
reducing bugs and improving correctness.

## ðŸŽ¯ Main Goal

The project shows how to model different object states using distinct types
and make state transitions explicit through methods. For example, a method
like `send()` can only be called if the object is in a `Connected` state,
and attempting to call it while `Disconnected` simply wonâ€™t compile.

## ðŸ“š Additional Learning Points

- âœ… **How to import and organize modules**  
  The code is structured across multiple files and modules. Itâ€™s a practical
  example of idiomatic module management and importing in Rust, with clear
  separation of concerns.

- âœ… **How to write functional tests**  
  Beyond unit tests, the repository includes **functional tests** under the
  `tests/` directory. These test higher-level behaviors and validate that
  state transitions work as intended across components.

## âœ… Why Use This Project

This repository is a useful reference for Rust developers who want to:

- Understand and apply the type-state pattern
- Learn proper project structure with multiple modules
- Write functional and integration-style tests
- Leverage Rustâ€™s type system to enforce business rules at compile time
